# Mock Data with Python
An attempt to generate dummy data for SFMC data extensions.
It starts simple with a table populated with fake data saved as CSV file. Import this file to a data extension in SFMC.
What is more challenging is to expand the approach into relational pipeline: 1-1, 1-many tables.
